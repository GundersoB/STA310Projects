df <- read.csv("https://grinnell-statistics.github.io/sta-310-s24/projects/USStates.csv")

```{r}

#ggplot(df, aes(HighSchool, CovidMortalityRate)) +
  #geom_point(aes(size = HouseholdIncome)) +
  #geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

```{r}
plot_ly(df, x = ~HighSchool, y = ~HouseholdIncome, z = ~CovidMortalityRate)
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(HighSchool, HouseholdIncome)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
cor(df$HighSchool, df$HouseholdIncome)
```

```{r}
mod <- lm(CovidMortalityRate ~ Insured + HighSchool + HouseholdIncome + Biden\Vote2020, data = df)
summary(mod)
```

Settle on research question (high school, household income, insurance)
